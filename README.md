# Stock-Price-Prediction
In this project, a deep learning-based approach was employed for predicting the stock prices of General Electric (GE) using historical stock data. The model integrates a Bidirectional LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) hybrid architecture to capture both short- and long-term dependencies in the time series data. The model is designed to predict the Adjusted Close price of GE by using multiple features, including Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume, as well as technical indicators like moving averages (MA_10, MA_30, MA_50) derived from the adjusted close price.

To ensure robust performance and prevent overfitting, TimeSeriesSplit cross-validation was employed, allowing the model to be evaluated over multiple training and testing iterations with historical data, where the training set always precedes the test set in the time sequence. The model was evaluated using multiple regression metrics, including Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and the Coefficient of Determination (R²).

The results demonstrated a strong predictive capability with an average MAPE of 1.3729 and high R² (0.981), indicating that the hybrid model can effectively forecast stock prices. This study highlights the potential of deep learning techniques in financial time series forecasting and the importance of employing suitable evaluation methods for time-dependent data.
